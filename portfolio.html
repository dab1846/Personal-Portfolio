        <p class="about-text">Hi there! My name is Daniel and I'm a sophmore at
          Northwestern University where I study computer science. When I'm not
          "on the grind," I like to spend my time cooking, reading, playing
          video games, or playing with one of my four pets! Feel free to click
          around this website to learn more about some of my work or ways to get
           in touch with me!</p>
        <p class="about-text">This portfolio was created as a project for CS 330:
          Human Computer Interaction.</p>
