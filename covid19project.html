        <p class="covproj-text">During the Spring Quarter of 2020, I was part
          of a class called IEMS 313: Optimization. In February, the professor
          of the course worked with the CDC to help optimize the distrobution
          of medical supplied in the United States to both minimize unmet demand
        and minimize total number of supplies used. During the quarter, we were
      given the same data and asked to create our own reports using what we
      learned about optimization.</p>
