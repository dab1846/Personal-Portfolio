        <p class="video-game-design-text">At Northwestern, I am part of a club called
        Pioneers of Interactive Entertainment (PIE) and at PIE we like to make games just
        as much as we like to play them. In my first year at Northwestern, I work on a team
        to design an 3D openwork RPG video game in Unity. Currently, I'm working on a
        a team with two other students to develop a puzzle game.</p>
